There are many ways to get this error. All of them involve a reference to a function or variable that the linker couldn't resolve, or find a definition for. The compiler can identify when a symbol isn't declared, but it can't tell when the symbol isn't defined. It's because the definition might be in a different source file or library. If a symbol is referred to but never defined, the linker generates an unresolved external symbol error.
In Visual Studio, make sure the source file that defines the symbol gets compiled as part of your project. Check the intermediate build output directory for a matching .obj file. If the source file isn't compiled, right-click on the file in Solution Explorer, and then choose Properties to check the properties of the file. The Configuration Properties > General page should show an Item Type of C/C++ Compiler. On the command line, make sure the source file that contains the definition is compiled.
In Visual Studio, make sure the object file or library that contains the symbol definition is linked as part of your project. On the command line, make sure the list of files to link includes the object file or library.
